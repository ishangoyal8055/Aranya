<u>WORKSHOPS:</u><br>
<u>1.	DIET-NUTRIENT SHOP AND FOOD SAFETY:</u><br>
Aiming at all the girls, and maybe guys as well(for today everyone is health conscience), we plan to set up a demonstrative and interactive workshop and call in an expert dietician, wherein we would test various food samples people are consuming and give them in figures- the amount of fat they are eating, the exact nutrition their food contains, much more than you could find on any pack backside.
<br>Also, you get one to one consultation with the dietician, wherein you can put forward any query or question that has been lingering in your mind about your health and diet!

<u>2. WORKSHOP ON BIOINFORMATICS AND ITS EMERGING DIMENSIONS</u><br>
Bioinformatics is playing a key role to establish a link between the information encoded in genomic sequences to the observed behaviour of living organisms. Bioinformatics tools are capable to recognize the hidden Biological Information.
