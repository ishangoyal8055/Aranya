<u>SWAT THE BUG</u><br>
Detecting bugs in the programs. Contenders will be evaluated on the basis of number of bugs eliminated, extent to which given programming logic is disturbed and efficiency of debugged codes. This contest puts forward a series of programs in JAVA/c/c++ to the participant with very trivial and subtle errors (bugs). The participant would have to identify the bugs and debug the code to get the correct/appropriate output for all valid test cases. This would essentially be a test of the programming logic, JAVA /c/c++ conceptual and implementation skills of the participants. Written Prelims followed by finals, on the same day.
