<u>SOAP CUTTING COMPETITION</u><br>


<u>Introduction:</u><br>
The competition is to not only raise competitive spirit, but also to promote coordination among participating students. Apart from these improving the students’ imaginative and creative skills as well as improving their ability to handcraft objects and models would be the prime motive of the competition.
<br>Our main emphasis will be on highlighting the benefits to be gained by students by participating in soap competition, which includes:<br>
?	Improved imaginative skills.<br>
?	Analyzing and understanding dimensions (useful in CAD, DWG and other software for mechanical and industrial engineering).<br>
?	Improved handcrafting skills.<br>
<u>Problem Statement:</u><br>
<br>Two member team will participate in competition. <br>The teams will be given, printed on A4 size sheets, drawings to be modeled by them on the soap. <br>The teams cannot use any other equipment to cut the soap, apart from those provided by the event organizers.
<br>The teams have to return the cutting equipment along the drawing sheet for evaluation; failing which they shall face disqualification from the event.



<u>RULES:</u><br>
The students would be judged on various criteria, prime ones being:<br>
1.	Accuracy of dimensions – as in judging any CAD model, the participants would first be judged on the basis of the dimensions of the model and its details. The dimensions of the cut soap must be equal or proportional to the objective and must include all its features. 
<br>2.	Final finish of the model – the next criteria for evaluation of the participants would be the final outlook and finish of the model, resembling the objective. Smooth surfaces and neatly cut features will be preferred.
<br>3.	Time taken – finally the students would be evaluated on the basis of the time taken for modeling and cutting the soap in the desired form. Preference will be given to ones consuming lesser time.
<br>
* In case of any conflict, the decision of the coordinating faculty would be final and binding.
<br>
<br>Change in rules, if any will be highlighted on the website and notified to the registered participants. The organizers reserve all rights to change any or all of the above rules as they deem fit.
