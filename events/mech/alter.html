<u>ALTERNATE ENERGY MODEL MAKING</u><br>
In sync with the theme of Aranya, we have decided to come up with an all new event aiming at producing electricity from sources and techniques anew. Cheap and innovative, this would usher the creativity regarding green energy in budding engineers. So much for tomorrow’s energy!
<br>
Event would be the showcase of the working model of various energy  producing techniques.  Based on real-life feasibility,  economic  and otherwise, and originality of the idea, the winners would be decided.
