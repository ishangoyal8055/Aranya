<u>LAND ROVER</u><br>

Land Rover  is a type of  ROBOT MACHINE  which has the ability  to move in the rough and tough situations  accompanied by the skills to perform operations of  picking and  placing the specimens.It  basically  is able to pick the specimens of different shapes(cylindrical,spherical,cuboidal)
Make a robot that can move on land, capable of picking and moving objects from one place to another and can carry a Specimen(Cylindrical or Cuboidal).
<br><u>
PROBLEM STATEMENT-</u><br>
Arena will be comprising of the Bridges  , Sand and GravelAreas , Muddy Areas , Speed Breakers ,See Saw (No Boundaries), Inclines The bot will have to follow a specific path which would be having some sharp turns picking and placing the specimens kept at heights to target places.The time and the performance of the bot will take the bot to the higher levels. It is basically similar to ROADIES in which the bot would have to perform certain tough tasks.
<br><u>SPECIFICATION OF BOT</u><br>
1.	The Robot should fit in a box of dimension of 1299 (Inches)<br>
2.	The input power should not be more than 12V, 2A DC<br>
3.	Any kind of power supply can be used such as (12V DC Accumulator, Adapters) and 240V, 50Hz AC supply will be available near the arena.<br>
4.	Wired or wireless controller can be used<br>
5.	All the connections should be safe and properly covered<br>
6.	Robot should be capable to pick and hold the object of different shapes of nearly same size from possible height for robot(approx 100-200mm). The maximum weight to be lifted would be (nearly 250gm).
<br><u>ARENA SPECIFICATION</u><br>
1.	      The Arena will be 16 by 12 feet.<br>
2.	First Obstacle- Bridge with Unprotected(No Boundary, Limited Span) downhill(minimum friction).<br>
3.	Second Obstacle- Speed Breakers<br>
4.	Third Obstacle- See Saw again Unprotected with Barbed wire,<br>
5.	Fourth Obstacle- Sand Areas(Off Road track) surrounded by pebbles.<br>
6.	Fifth obstacle: Ramp from which bot has to jump into a pit.<br>
7.	Specification<br>
    The Arena would be having only 2 specimens-<br>
        1.  Cylindrical<br>   2. Cuboidal<br>
And one cosco ball will be used.<br>
8.	There will be 2 drop points of specimens.<br>


<u>EVENT SPECIFICATION</u><br>
BALANCE-FIRST ROUND<br>
         In this round, Specimens will be two - Cylindrical and Cuboidal. Cylindrical at point A and Cuboidal at point B . The robot will have to pick the cylindrical specimen and place it at point B and have to pick the Cuboidal specimen from that point and place it at point. Evaluation is based on points. Whoever finishes aggravate their chances for qualifying the BALANCE.
<br>ULTIMATE-SECOND ROUND<br>
        The stage in which thrill enhances itself. Is your bot ready to accept a bigger challenge?  It will  consist of a sandy arena with pebbles.In tis a Cosco Ball will be given and Bot has to cross the sandy arena and then roll over through the speed breakers(may be along with a little water)  has to drag the ball from starting point into the goal post.Whosoever does it first will be qualified for the next round.
<br>ROVER V.3 LAKSHYA STUNT-FINAL DESTINATION ROUND<br>
        <br> Now its the battle between the real players. Is your bot fast and powerfull enough to capture the victory?This is the time for your Bot to show Stunting DNA. In this the bot has to first climb up the see saw(Unprotected) and then roll down and using the kinetic energy gained during this,the bot has to climb up a ramp of comparatively low inclination and like stunts in the cars it has to jump from the ramp in to a sand pit. In this points will be given depending on how far your bot has reached from the ramp end point.

<br><u>RULES:</u><br>
1.	In case of a tie in any sort or any form,coordinators decision will be final.
<br>2.	At any time in the course of the tournament, if a bot falls from an obstacle or fails to complete an obstacle or stop working, the bot will have a choice to placed at the starting point or have deduction of points.(The deduction amount will be announced before the commencement of the event).
<br>3.	 In first round the bot cannot drag the specimen, it has to lift the specimen atleast that at much that there could be a visible gap between the specimen and ground.
<br>4.	No team is allowed to hinder the functioning of bots of opponents team. Failing to do so will straight away lead to disqualification.
<br>5.	No team is allowed to touch directly or indirectly the bots of opponents team. Failing to do so will straight away lead to disqualification.
<br>6.	During the match, the team members are not allowed to touch the machine or the arena. Failure to do so will lead to disqualification.
<br>7.	    Any kind of assistance through edges for locomotion will lead to a disqualification.
<br>8.	    Any kind of damage to the arena will attract disqualification.
<br>9.	    The teams will be asked to get ready 5 minutes before the start of the match.
<br>10.	    Judges have the right to disqualify any team if they feel the team is not playing with fair interests.
