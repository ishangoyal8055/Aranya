<u>ROBO WARS</u><br>
Introduction</u><br>
Controlling robots and indulging in a fight of the robots. Imagine the excitement of fighting a robot guided by you and fighting of the opponent to prove yourself as the Real Steel.
<br><u>Task</u><br>
•	Teams must build a wireless or wired controlled machine.<br>
•	The robots must compete in a one-on-one match following the basic system of traditional sumo matches.<br>
•	No weapons and no flipping mechanisms are allowed.<br>
•	The robot must push its opponent out of the arena to win the match. The game must be a defensive one and robot’s behaviour must be non-offensive and non-destructive to opponents.
 <br>
<u>Arena</u><br>
<br>1.	The arena will be circular in shape with a diameter of 770 mm, including the line which separates inner and outer sides of the arena.
<br>2.	Two line called ‘Shikiri’ lines are drawn at the center of the arena with a distance of 100 mm between them. These two lines are the starting positions of the robots. The two robots will be placed just behind each of the lines at the start of the match. These are 10mm thick and 100 mm long. They will be red in colour.
<br>3.	The Ring shall be marked by a white circular line of 25 mm thickness. The Ring is within the outside boundary of this circular line i.e. the thickness of this line will also be included as part of the ring. A robot shall be considered as winner if it is able to push its opponent out across this line (out of the ring).
<br>4.	All the lines will be of white color and the surface of the arena will be black in color. The ‘Shikiri’ line will be red in color.

<br><u>Dimension And Specifications</u><br>
<br>1.	Machine should fit in a box of dimensions 150mm x 150mm (l x b) at the start of the match. However there is no restriction on height of the robot. The external wireless controller device which is used to control the machine is not included in the size constraint.
<br>2.	The weight of the robot should not exceed 1 kg.
<br>3.	The machine should be controlled by a wireless or wired remote control mechanism throughout the run.
<br>4.	Each team is allowed to have only one machine.
<br>5.	The machine must be stable and must stand on its own at the beginning of the run when it is placed at the starting point. Machine not fulfilling this criterion will be disqualified.
<br>6.	During the run, the machine can expand itself provided it does not damage the arena in anyway. Any machine found damaging the arena will be immediately disqualified. The final decision is at the discretion of the organisers. It should not be attacking and cause destruction to opponent, only normal push and bangs are allowed.
<br>7.	The teams are allowed to use ready-made micro-controller boards/ready-made sensor kits.


<br><u>Power Supply and Propulsion.</u><br>
<br>1.	The potential difference between any two points of the machine must not exceed 15 V DC.
<br>2.	The method of propulsion is at the discretion of the builder, provided that the power source is non-polluting.

<br><u>Gameplay</u><br>
<br>Each match will consist of three rounds, whichever team wins at least two out of the three matches shall be declared as winner. The aim of the robots must be to push their opponents out of the ring. The robots mustn’t cause any harm to the opponent robot. There should be no intentional destruction caused to the opponent and no weapon/mechanism is allowed which could cause damage to the opponent. The game is based on Sumo wrestling which is purely a defensive art. 


<br><u>Rules</u><br>
<br>1.	Jamming devices are not allowed.
<br>2.	Do not use parts that could break or damage the Ring. Do not use parts that are intended to damage the opponent robot. Normal pushes and bangs are not considered intent to damage.
<br>3.	Do not put devices into a robot's body that can store liquid, powder, or air that is intended to be used against an opponent.
<br>4.	Do not use devices that throw things at your opponent.
<br>5.	Do not stick a robot down onto the Ring, using sucking devices or glue, or use any type of sticky tires (such as double sticky foam tape) or any device to assist in adding more down force (such as a vacuum device).


<br><u>General Rules</u><br>
<br>1.	Any team that is not ready at the time specified will be disqualified from the competition automatically.
<br>2.	The machine would be checked for its safety if found unsafe for other teams and spectators it will be disqualified.
<br>3.	Judges decision shall be treated as final and binding on all.
<br>4.	Any bot found to damage the ring will be immediately disqualified.
<br>5.	Any bot found to have a weapon or destructive mechanism will be disqualified.
<br>6.	If any bot is judged to cause intentional damage to their opponent bot will be disqualified. This decision will be at discretion of judges and their decision would be considered final and binding on all.
<br>7.	The bot is not allowed to leave anything behind, all components should be rigidly fitted on the machine, there should be no falling off of parts of the robot.
<br>8.	Only one member of the team is allowed to handle the bot. Participants are not allowed to keep anything inside the ring other than their bot.
<br>9.	The dimensions of the arena would be accurate to within 5% or 20 mm, whichever is less.

<br><u>Judging</u><br>
<br>The competition will be based on single elimination playoff i.e. whoever wins the match will advance to the next round and this method of elimination will continue up to the final round. 
<br><u>Team Specification</u><br>
