<u>WATER ROCKETRY COMPETITION</u><br>

<u>DESCRIPTION:</u><br>
Flying water rockets is a relatively safe and inexpensive way for students to learn the basics of forces and the response of a vehicle to external forces. A model rocket is subjected to four forces in flight; weight, thrust, and the aerodynamic forces, lift and drag.
 <br><br>
<u>GENERAL VIEW OF WATER ROCKET</u><br>
The water rocket system consists of two main parts, the launcher and the rocket. Usually the rocket is made from a 2-liter soda pop bottle. Before launch, the bottle is filled with some amount of water, which acts as the "propellant" for the launch. Since water is about 100 times heavier than air, the expelled water produces more thrust than compressed air alone. The base of the bottle is only slightly larger than the launch tube. When the rocket is placed on the launch tube, the body tube becomes a closed pressure vessel. The pressure inside the body tube equals the pressure produced by the air pump. Fins are attached to the bottom of the body tube to provide stability during the flight.
<br>The launcher has a base to support the rocket during launch. A hollow launch tube is mounted perpendicular to the base and is inserted into the base of the rocket before launch. The launch tube is connected to an air pump by a hollow feeder line. The pump is used to pressurize the inside of the body tube to provide thrust for the rocket. We have attached a pressure gage to the feeder line to display the change in pressure in the system.
<br><br><u>OBJECTIVE:</u><br>
This invites the ‘mechanical’ brains to come and show the power of mechanchees. What we are looking for is not a spark in an engine, just a little one in the heads.
Improving the students’ imaginative and creative skills as well as improving their ability to handcraft objects and models would be the prime motive of the competition.
Our main emphasis will be on highlighting the benefits to be gained by students by participating in Water Rocketry competition, which includes:
1. Improved imaginative skills.
2. Analyzing and understanding dimensions (useful in CAD, DWG and other software for mechanical and industrial engineering).
3. Improved handcrafting skills.

<br><br> <u>SPECIFICATIONS</u><br>
Only one 2 liter plastic bottle can be used.<br>
You can modify the bottle according to your wish.<br>
Only water and compressed air should be used as fuel.<br>
All the teams should have their own launchers.<br>
Air pump will be provided.<br>
            
<br><u>RULES </u><br>
Two rounds will be there<br>
1. range of flight<br>
2. time of flight<br>
Teams for 2nd round will be selected according to there performance in 1st round.<br>
<br>
Change in rules, if any will be highlighted on the website and notified to the registered participants. The organizers reserve all rights to change any or all of the above rules as they deem fit.
